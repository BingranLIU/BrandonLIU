Project Experience
======
* Samsung S25 On-Device-Cloud AI
  * Contributed to the 0-to-1 development of the Samsung & Zhipu collaboration, leading technical integration, product development, new Bixby architecture, and fine-tuning of large models. Led VLM model design and tuning for Samsung S25. Managed technical interfaces for 10+ large model products, resolving issues across visual, voice, video, and AutoGLM technologies. Outperformed Qwen and ERNIE, securing multi-million-dollar deals and launching the project as a companylevel initiative. Participated in the signing ceremony and oversaw R&D. Provided support for ZTE and Transsion projects.
* FWD/CMHK-RAG System
  * Designed and implemented an RAG system using GLM large models and vector knowledge bases, handling intent
recognition, entity extraction, instruction routing, and global memory architecture. Managed end-to-end responsibilities, including requirements, development, deployment, and optimization. Built on Microsoftâ€™s GraphRAG to extract global information, optimized embeddings, and designed a multi-turn shard recall method. Achieved a 98.3% success rate in meeting expectations. Delivered a PoC for a contract worth over 3 million RMB and compiled related algorithms, models
* International Sales Forecast System
  * Collaborated with the International Department to develop a sales forecast model for seven key markets. Led factor selection, data modeling, and algorithm optimization through interviews with country directors. Integrated regression and time-series algorithms to address challenges like historical data bias, poor quality, and incomplete metrics. Coordinated resources across design, product, frontend, and business teams for successful development and integration. Achieved a 90+ business satisfaction score and improved prediction accuracy to 82% for five key markets.
* Marketing Algorithms and Data Mining
  * Lead Scoring: Developed a lead scoring model using logistic regression on a 3M+ user dataset, identifying behavioral variables across stages for private and public domain scoring. Extended this to on-site scoring and churn reactivation models
  * Data Analysis: Contributed to key marketing analytics projects, including SCRM system operations, lead churn, and unsubscribes. Led the creation of 40+ ADS and hundreds of analytics indicators, enabling the visualization of terminal anomalies and operational quality
  * Data Gover nance: Documented full marketing logic and resolved issues like lead state gaps and data deficiencies. Traced SCRM module defects, participated in data governance architecture implementation, and optimized structural and metric designs. Compiled an NLP knowledge base with 30,000+ words.
