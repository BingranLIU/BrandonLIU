I am currently employed as an AI Engineer at leading large language model company Z.ai([Z.ai](https://z.ai)), where my primary responsibilities encompass the global deployment and implementation of the Tsinghua GLM large language model framework, along with the application of AI technologies. My work focuses on the practical implementation of large language model capabilities in global contexts.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information System from the Harbin Institute of Technology. I am presently pursuing a Master's degree in Financial Big Data through a collaborative program between the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen International Graduate School. I have been selected for the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Programme and have been awarded a scholarship (Erasmus+).

Prior to my current position, I served as an Algorithm Engineer at a publicly-listed Fortune Global 500 corporation, responsible for machine learning algorithm research. My technical expertise encompasses the application of large-scale models in edge computing environments, real-time communication protocols for multimodal models, multi-agent system architecture, and intelligent marketing solutions. I have been a key contributor to significant projects, including the Samsung Bixby AI initiative and the National Sovereignty Large Model Project.
