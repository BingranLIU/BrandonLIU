I am currently employed as an **Artificial Intelligence Engineer**, the first AI engineer in the Asia-Pacific region, at leading **large language model company [Z.ai](https://z.ai)**, where my primary responsibilities encompass the global deployment and commercialization of *GLM-based capabilities and derivative products*, with a *focus on national sovereignty model construction projects*. I have participated in or led the internationalization of the model and its series, *involving model training*, application development and architectural design, collaborating deeply with *national government agencies, multinational corporations, and local universities and research institutes*, dedicated to efficiently transforming large model technical capabilities into practical solutions for various industries globally.

I obtained my **Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information System** from the **Harbin Institute of Technology**. I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Financial Big Data** through a collaborative program between **Tsinghua University's** School of Economics and Management and Shenzhen International Graduate School, *with a research focus on in-depth large model research and agentic systems*, while also participating in academic collaborations with overseas universities based on big data. I was admitted to the **Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme (Erasmus+)** and have *visited or exchanged with institutions such as Tohoku University, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the University of Malaya as an academic visitor or competition judge*.

Prior to my current position, I served as an **ML Algorithm Engineer** at a publicly-listed Fortune Global 500 corporation, responsible for *the development of machine learning and data mining algorithms*. My technical expertise encompasses *small language model training*, the application of large-scale models in edge computing environments, *real-time communication for* multimodal models, multi-agent system architecture, *and agentic architecture and applications, along with experience in the commercialization of large model industries*. I have been a key contributor to significant projects, including the **Samsung Bixby AI initiative** and *multiple* **National Sovereignty Large Model Projects**.
