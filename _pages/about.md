I am currently employed as an _**Artificial Intelligence Engineer**_ at leading _**large language model company [Z.ai](https://z.ai)**_, serving as Z.ai's first AI engineer in the Asia-Pacific region. My primary responsibilities encompass the global deployment and commercialization based on the capabilities of the *GLM large language model* and its derivative products, currently focusing on projects related to national sovereign model construction. I have participated in or led the internationalization of the model and its series of products, involving model training, application development, and architectural design, collaborating deeply with national government agencies, multinational corporations, local universities, and research institutes, dedicated to efficiently transforming large model technical capabilities into practical solutions for various industries globally.

I obtained my _**Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information System**_ from the _**Harbin Institute of Technology**_. I am currently pursuing a _**Master's degree in Financial Big Data**_ through a collaborative program between _**Tsinghua University's**_ School of Economics and Management and Shenzhen International Graduate School, with a research focus on in-depth research of large models and agentic systems. I also participate in academic collaborations with overseas universities based on big data. I was also once admitted to the _**Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme(Erasmus+)**_, and have visited or exchanged with multiple institutions such as Tohoku University, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and University of Malaya in capacities such as academic visitor and competition judge.

Prior to my current position, I served as an _**ML Algorithm Engineer**_ at a publicly-listed Fortune Global 500 corporation, responsible for machine learning and data mining related algorithm development. My technical expertise encompasses minority language model training, application of models in edge computing environments, real-time communication for multimodal models, multi-agent system architecture, agentic architecture and applications, and possess certain experience in the commercialization of large models in the industry. I have been a key contributor to significant projects, including the _**Samsung Bixby AI initiative**_ and multiple _**national sovereign large model projects**_.
