Currently serving as an AI Engineer at Z.ai([Z.ai](https://z.ai)), I lead the global deployment and implementation of the Tsinghua GLM large language model framework, focusing on practical applications and operational execution across diverse environments.

My academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in Information Management and Information Systems from Harbin Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Financial Big Data through a joint program between Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management and the Shenzhen International Graduate School. I have been selected for the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Programme with an Erasmus+ scholarship.

Professionally, I previously worked as an Algorithm Engineer at a Fortune Global 500 company, where I specialized in data mining and machine learning algorithm engineering. This experience, followed by my role at a large model company, has honed my expertise in deploying large-scale models for edge computing, developing real-time communication protocols for multimodal systems, designing multi-agent architectures, and creating intelligent marketing solutions. I have contributed significantly to key projects including the Samsung Bixby AI initiative and the National Sovereignty Large Model.
